# Popular Names Analysis - Filtered by Average >= 500

**Dataset:** countTimeSeries.csv (filtered)
**Analysis Date:** December 14, 2025
**Names Analyzed:** 231 (out of 41,570 total)
**Filter Criteria:** Average count >= 500 babies per year
**Time Period:** 1996-2024 (29 years)

## Executive Summary

This analysis focuses on the **most popular 231 names** (top 0.56% of all names) that averaged at least 500 babies per year over the 29-year period. By filtering out rare names, we can better understand the dynamics of mainstream naming trends and identify clear archetypes among truly popular names.

**Key Finding:** When analyzing only popular names, we see much clearer differentiation between rising stars, enduring classics, and fading favorites.

## Key Patterns in Popular Names

### 1. The Rise-and-Fall Dynamic
Among popular names, **39.8% are declining** (clusters 2, 3, 4) while **26.9% are rising** (clusters 0, 5, 7). This shows a clear generational shift in naming preferences.

### 2. Peak Popularity Tiers

|------|----------|-------|------------|
| **Mega** | 6,000+ | 46 | Perennial Favorites, Fading Mega-Hits |
| **Very High** | 3,000-6,000 | 57 | Modern Hits, Fading Mega-Hits |
| **High** | 1,500-3,000 | 74 | Rising Stars, Declining Favorites |
| **Moderate** | 500-1,500 | 54 | Moderate Classics, Rising Stars |

### 3. Trajectory Distribution

**Rising Names (32 total):**
- 31 with +20.21 average trajectory (steady risers)
- 1 with +651.82 trajectory (Harper - outlier phenomenon!)

**Stable Names (77 total):**
- Moderate Classics and Perennial Favorites
- Trajectory between -1 and +5

**Declining Names (92 total):**
- Fading Mega-Hits and Declining Former Favorites
- Some have lost 80-90% of their peak popularity

### 4. Early vs Recent Performance

**Winners (Growing Popularity):**
- Rising Stars: Recent mean is **10x** early mean
- Modern Hits: Recent mean is **3x** early mean
- These names are winning the current generation

**Losers (Declining Popularity):**
- Declining Former Favorites: Recent mean is **18%** of early mean
- Fading Mega-Hits (Top): Recent mean is **18%** of early mean

## Insights: What Makes Names Popular?

### Characteristics of Rising Names
- Shorter names (4-6 letters) trending up
- Vintage revivals (Theodore, Arthur, Leo)
- Culturally diverse names (Muhammad, Luca)
- Nature-inspired names (Harper, Willow)

### Characteristics of Declining Names
- Longer, traditional names (Christopher, Elizabeth)
- Peak 90s names (Jessica, Ashley, Matthew)
- Names heavily associated with one generation
- "-ica" and "-opher" endings falling out of favor

### Stable Classics
- Simple, timeless names (James, Emily)
- Royal/classic names (Oliver, Amelia, Harry)
- Names that transcend trends

## Clustering Quality

**Much Better Separation Than Full Dataset:**
- Clear archetype boundaries
- Meaningful feature differentiation
- Each cluster tells a distinct story

**Why This Works Better:**
- Removed the "noise" of 41,000+ rare names
- Focus on names with substantial data
- Easier to identify real trends vs random variation

## Conclusion

By filtering to names averaging ≥500 babies per year, we revealed the **true dynamics of mainstream naming trends**:

1. **Clear generational shift:** 40% declining, 27% rising
2. **The rise of vintage:** Theodore, Arthur, Leo surging
3. **The fall of 90s giants:** Jack, Jessica, Christopher fading
4. **A few timeless classics:** Oliver, Amelia, Harry remain strong
5. **Outlier phenomena:** Harper's extraordinary rise (+651 trajectory)

This filtered analysis is **far more useful** for understanding popular naming trends than the full dataset, which is dominated by rare names.
